## Learning approach

At StartSchool, we believe **the best way to learn is by doing**. This course:
- Provides hands-on tasks, not just theory
- Encourages exploration and experimentation
- Uses real-world examples and projects
- Teaches you to learn like developers do: reading docs, googling, and trying things

You won't memorize everything - instead, you'll learn how to find information and solve problems, just like professional developers do every day.
