## Authentication and security

### The bouncer and security system

Authentication and security are like a restaurant's security measures:
- **Checking ID**: Verifying you are who you say you are (authentication)
- **Table assignments**: Determining what you're allowed to access (authorization)
- **Security cameras**: Logging who did what and when (audit trails)
- **Safe**: Protecting sensitive information (encryption)

### Key security concepts

| Concept | What it means | Real-world example |
|---------|---------------|-------------------|
| Authentication | Proving who you are | Logging in with username and password |
| Authorization | What you're allowed to do | Admins can delete posts, regular users cannot |
| Encryption | Scrambling data so others can't read it | Credit card numbers stored as gibberish |
| Tokens | A temporary pass after you log in | Session that lasts until you log out |
| Hashing | One-way scrambling of passwords | Storing passwords so even the company can't see them |

### Why security happens in backend

**Never trust the frontend**: Anything in the frontend can be manipulated by users. Security checks must happen where users can't interfere.

**Example of bad practice**:
- Frontend: "User clicked 'buy' button, they must have enough money"
- Backend: Should check the actual account balance

**Example of good practice**:
- Frontend: Sends purchase request
- Backend: Verifies user identity, checks actual balance, validates product availability, processes payment, then confirms
