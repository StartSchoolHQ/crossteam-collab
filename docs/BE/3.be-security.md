# Authentication and security

## Why security matters in the backend

Security isn't optional - it's the foundation of trust in your application. Every time users share personal information, make a purchase, or interact with your platform, they're trusting you to protect their data and privacy. One security breach can expose sensitive information, destroy user trust, and have serious legal consequences.

## Why security must happen in the backend

**The golden rule: never trust the frontend**

Anything in the frontend can be seen, modified, or bypassed by users. A determined person can:
- Change what data gets sent to your backend
- Pretend to be an admin by modifying their user role in the browser
- Skip validation checks you added in javascript
- Read any "secret" keys or passwords in your frontend code

This is why all security checks must happen in the backend, where users have no access.

## Key security concepts

| Concept | What it means | Real-world example | Why it matters |
|---------|---------------|-------------------|----------------|
| Authentication | Proving who you are | Logging in with username and password, two-factor authentication codes | Ensures only the real account owner can access their data |
| Authorization | What you're allowed to do once identified | Admins can delete any post, regular users can only delete their own | Prevents users from accessing or modifying data they shouldn't |
| Encryption | Scrambling data so it's unreadable without the key | Credit card numbers stored as random-looking gibberish | Protects sensitive data even if someone gains unauthorized access to the database |
| Tokens | A temporary pass after you log in | Session token that lasts until you log out or expires after 24 hours | Lets you stay logged in without sending your password with every request |
| Hashing | One-way scrambling that can't be reversed | Passwords stored so even the company can't see them, only verify if you entered the right one | Protects passwords even if the database is stolen |

## Common security vulnerabilities

**SQL injection** - attackers insert malicious code into database queries through input fields

**Cross-site scripting (XSS)** - attackers inject malicious scripts that run in other users' browsers

**Broken authentication** - weak password requirements, missing logout functionality, or exposed session tokens

**Sensitive data exposure** - storing passwords in plain text, sending credit card numbers unencrypted, or logging sensitive information

## Examples: bad vs good security

**Example 1: making a purchase**

**Bad practice:**
- Frontend checks if user has enough money in their account
- If yes, frontend tells backend "process this purchase"
- Backend processes it without checking

Why this fails: a user could modify the frontend code to always say they have enough money, getting free purchases.

**Good practice:**
- Frontend sends purchase request
- Backend verifies user identity with their token
- Backend checks actual account balance in the database
- Backend validates product exists and is available
- Backend processes payment securely
- Backend confirms or rejects the purchase

**Example 2: deleting content**

❌ **Bad practice:**
- Frontend shows delete button only to admins
- When clicked, backend deletes the post

Why this fails: a regular user could inspect the page code, find the delete function, and trigger it manually to delete posts they shouldn't be able to.

✅ **Good practice:**
- Frontend shows delete button based on permissions
- Backend receives delete request
- Backend verifies who sent the request
- Backend checks if that user has permission to delete this specific post
- Backend deletes only if authorized, otherwise returns an error

**Example 3: viewing sensitive data**

❌ **Bad practice:**
- Backend sends all user data to frontend
- Frontend decides what to display based on user role

Why this fails: anyone can open browser developer tools and see all the data, including information they shouldn't access.

**Good practice:**
- Frontend requests specific data
- Backend checks what the requesting user is authorized to see
- Backend sends only the data that user should access
- Frontend displays what it receives
