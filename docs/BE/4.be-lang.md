### What non-developers should know

You don't need to learn these languages, but understanding their characteristics helps with:

**Planning**: "We need real-time notifications" → Node.js might be good  
**Hiring**: "We're a Microsoft shop" → C# developers would fit well  
**Communication**: "The data processing is slow" → Might need Python optimization or different approach
