### Option A: Reading only

1. **Read the code**: Go through each file below
2. **Understand the flow**: Follow what happens step-by-step
3. **Trace scenarios**: Work through the three scenarios on paper
4. **Answer questions**: Complete the questions without running code

**Note**: If you try to open `index.html` in a browser, you'll see errors. This is expected since the backend isn't running.
