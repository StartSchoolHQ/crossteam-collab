## Hands-on: building a simple backend with Express and mock database

This hands-on demonstration shows you what backend code actually looks like, and how the frontend communicates with it. You'll see both the frontend (making requests) and backend (processing them) to understand the complete flow.

**Purpose**: understand the complete flow from frontend button click → API request → backend validation → database operations → response → frontend display

## Important instructions

### Two ways to complete this exercise

You can choose how you want to work with this code:

#### **Option A: reading only (recommended for non-developers)**
- Read the code in this document or copy it to your IDE
- Trace through the scenarios on paper/document
- Focus on understanding concepts without technical setup
- **Time needed**: 2-3 hours
- **Requirements**: none - just read and think

#### **Option B: actually run it (optional - for those who want to see it work)**
- Set up the backend server
- See the application actually work in your browser
- Watch data change in real-time
- **Time needed**: 3-4 hours (includes setup)
- **Requirements**: Node.js installed on your computer

Both options teach you the same concepts. Choose based on your comfort level and goals.
