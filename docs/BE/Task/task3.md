### Option B: Actually run it

Follow these steps to get the application running:

#### Step 1: Install Node.js
- Go to https://nodejs.org/
- Download and install Node.js (LTS version)
- Verify installation: Open terminal/command prompt and type `node --version`

#### Step 2: Create project folder
```bash
# Create a folder for your project
mkdir backend-demo
cd backend-demo
```

#### Step 3: Initialize Node.js project
```bash
# Initialize npm (creates package.json)
npm init -y
```

#### Step 4: Install required packages
```bash
# Install Express and CORS
npm install express cors
```

#### Step 5: Create following files and move to the next section in the task to copy the code from the code sections into each file.  

Create these 4 files in your project folder:
- `index.html`
- `style.css`
- `app.js`
- `server.js`


---

<!-- #### Step 6: Start the backend server
```bash
# In your terminal, run:
node server.js
```

You should see:
```
Server running on http://localhost:3000

Available endpoints:
  GET  /api/products
  GET  /api/products/:id
  POST /api/orders
  GET  /api/orders
```

#### Step 7: Open the frontend
- Open `index.html` in your web browser (double-click the file, or right-click → Open With → Chrome/Firefox)
- You should see the products load
- Try placing an order!

#### Step 8: Watch what happens
- **In the browser**: Open Developer Tools (F12) → Console tab to see frontend logs
- **In the terminal**: Watch the terminal where `server.js` is running to see backend logs

You'll see both sides communicating in real-time!
