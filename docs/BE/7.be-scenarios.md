## Real-world backend scenarios

### Scenario 1: E-commerce checkout

**What you see**: Click "Place order" button

**What backend does**:
1. Verifies user is logged in
2. Checks all items are still in stock
3. Validates shipping address
4. Calculates tax based on location
5. Processes payment through payment provider
6. Creates order record in database
7. Reduces inventory counts
8. Sends confirmation email
9. Notifies warehouse system
10. Returns confirmation to frontend

**Why it takes time**: Each step needs to complete successfully, and payment processing must be secure.

### Scenario 2: Social media feed

**What you see**: Scroll through posts

**What backend does**:
1. Identifies who you follow
2. Retrieves recent posts from database
3. Applies filtering rules (blocked users, reported content)
4. Ranks posts by algorithm (popularity, relevance, recency)
5. Loads images from storage
6. Formats everything for frontend
7. Tracks what you viewed for future recommendations

**Why personalization matters**: Two users see different feeds from the same backend because server-side logic customizes the response.

### Scenario 3: Real-time collaboration

**What you see**: Another user's cursor moving in a shared document

**What backend does**:
1. Receives edit from User A
2. Validates change and user permissions
3. Stores change in database
4. Broadcasts to all connected users viewing that document
5. Handles conflicts if users edit same section
6. Maintains document history for undo/version control

**Technology choice**: This needs WebSocket connections (real-time) rather than standard API calls.
