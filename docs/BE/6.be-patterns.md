## Backend architecture patterns

### Different kitchen layouts

Just as restaurants can organize their kitchens differently, backends can be structured in different ways.

| Pattern | Description | When to use | Example |
|---------|-------------|-------------|---------|
| Monolithic | Everything in one large application | Smaller projects, simpler needs | Early-stage startup with one product |
| Microservices | Separate small services that communicate | Large scale, different teams | Netflix has separate services for recommendations, streaming, billing |
| Serverless | Code runs only when needed, no permanent server | Variable traffic, specific tasks | Image processing that happens when users upload photos |

### What this means for teams

**Monolithic**:
- One team can understand the whole system
- Easier to develop initially
- Changes can affect everything

**Microservices**:
- Teams can work independently on different services
- One service failing doesn't crash everything
- More complex to coordinate

**Communication tip**: When discussing projects, understand which pattern your company uses. It affects timelines, team structure, and how changes are made.

## Practical backend considerations

### Performance and scaling

As your application grows, the backend needs to handle more requests:

**Scaling strategies**:
- **Vertical**: Get a bigger server (upgrade the kitchen)
- **Horizontal**: Add more servers (open multiple kitchens)
- **Caching**: Store common results temporarily (keep popular dishes ready)
- **Load balancing**: Distribute requests across servers (send customers to different kitchens)

### Monitoring and maintenance

Backend systems need constant attention:
- **Logging**: Record what happens for debugging
- **Monitoring**: Track performance and errors
- **Backups**: Regularly save database contents
- **Updates**: Apply security patches and improvements

**Why this matters for non-developers**: When you report a bug or request a feature, backend work often involves these considerations. "Why does this take so long?" might be answered by "We need to migrate the database safely without losing customer data."
