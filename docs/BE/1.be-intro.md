# Understanding backend systems

## Introduction

If APIs are the menu that helps frontend and backend communicate, then the backend is the entire kitchen operation - from storing ingredients to preparing meals to managing orders. 

## What is a backend/server?

### The kitchen analogy

- **Frontend**: The dining room where customers sit, read menus, and place orders
- **API**: - **API**: The waiter who takes orders from customers (frontend) and delivers them to the kitchen (backend), then brings the prepared food back to the customer
- **Backend**: The kitchen where food is prepared, recipes are stored, and inventory is managed
- **Server**: Not the person who brings food, but the kitchen itself that processes all requests

The backend handles the data and logic behind what users see. When you search for a product, post a comment, or check your account balance, the frontend sends your request to the backend, which processes it and sends back the result.

### Server vs Backend
Server = The physical or virtual computer/machine that runs 24/7 and responds to requests  
Backend = The application code, logic, databases, and systems that run ON the server


### What servers actually do

A server is simply a computer that:
- Runs 24/7 to handle requests
- Stores and retrieves data
- Processes business logic
- Manages security and user permissions
- Coordinates with other systems

**Real-world example**: When you log into Netflix, the backend verifies your password, retrieves your watch history, recommends shows based on your preferences, and streams video content - all while the frontend simply displays the results.
