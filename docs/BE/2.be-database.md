## Databases and data storage

### The pantry and filing system

If the backend is the kitchen, the database is the pantry and filing cabinet combined. It's where everything is stored in an organized way so it can be found quickly.

### Types of databases

| Database type | What it stores | Restaurant analogy | Common tools |
|---------------|----------------|-------------------|--------------|
| Relational (SQL) | Structured data in tables with relationships | Recipe cards organized in categories with cross-references | PostgreSQL, MySQL, SQL Server |
| Document (NoSQL) | Flexible data in document format | A cookbook where each recipe can have different fields | MongoDB, Couchbase |
| Key-value | Simple pairs of keys and values | A spice rack where each container is labeled | Redis, DynamoDB |
| Graph | Data with complex relationships | The network of suppliers, ingredients, and dishes | Neo4j |

### When to use what

**Relational databases** work well when:
- Data has clear relationships (customers have orders, orders have items)
- You need consistency (bank transactions must be accurate)
- Structure is predictable

**Document databases** work well when:
- Data structure varies (different products have different attributes)
- You need flexibility and speed
- Relationships are simple

**Real-world example**: An e-commerce company might use PostgreSQL for order processing and user accounts (needs accuracy and relationships), Redis for shopping cart data (needs speed), and MongoDB for product catalog (needs flexibility for different product types).
