# How backend connects to frontend

## The bridge between worlds

Remember the waiter from our restaurant analogy? The API is how the frontend (dining room) and backend (kitchen) actually communicate. The backend builds what the API promises.

**API says:** "POST /api/cart adds item to cart"  
**Backend does:** all the logic to make that happen safely and correctly

## Real example: adding to cart

When you click "add to cart," here's what happens:

**1. Frontend → API**  
User clicks button. Frontend sends: "add this item to my cart"

**2. API → Backend**  
Backend receives the request and asks: "who is this user? Is this request valid?"

**3. Backend works**  
- Finds user's cart in database
- Checks if product exists and is available
- Calculates current price
- Updates cart

**4. Backend → API → Frontend**  
Backend sends back: "success! Here's your updated cart"

**5. Frontend updates**  
Cart icon updates, success message appears

## The flow visualized
```
User clicks button
       ↓
Frontend prepares request
       ↓
API receives request → Backend checks auth
       ↓
Backend processes logic
       ↓
Backend queries database
       ↓
Backend sends response → API delivers it
       ↓
Frontend updates display
```
