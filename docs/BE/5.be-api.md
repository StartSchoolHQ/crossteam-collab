## How backend connects to frontend via APIs

### The complete order flow

Let's trace a complete example: A user adds an item to their shopping cart.

**Step 1: Frontend action**
- User clicks "Add to cart" button
- Frontend prepares API request: POST /api/cart with item details

**Step 2: Backend receives request**
- Server receives the request
- Checks authentication token: "Is this user logged in?"
- Validates data: "Is this a real product? Is the quantity reasonable?"

**Step 3: Backend processes**
- Retrieves user's current cart from database
- Checks product availability
- Calculates any price changes or promotions
- Updates cart in database

**Step 4: Backend responds**
- Formats response with updated cart
- Sends back to frontend

**Step 5: Frontend updates**
- Receives confirmation
- Updates the cart icon
- Shows success message

### The API is the bridge

Remember from Session 4: The API defines how frontend and backend communicate. The backend implements what the API promises.

**API documentation says**: "POST /api/cart adds item to cart"  
**Backend implements**: All the logic to actually make that happen safely and correctly
