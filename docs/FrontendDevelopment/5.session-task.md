## Your mission

Build an "About Me" (or "About Us" if working in a team) webpage from scratch using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Your page will include a button that shows "Hello World!" when clicked.

**Time: 3 hours**

---

## Part 1: Setup your development environment 

### Step 1: Download VS Code

1. Go to [https://code.visualstudio.com/](https://code.visualstudio.com/)
2. Download VS Code for your operating system (Windows, Mac, or Linux)
3. Install it (follow the installation wizard)
4. Open VS Code

### Step 2: Install Live Server extension

1. In VS Code, click the **Extensions** icon on the left sidebar (looks like 4 squares)
2. Search for "Live Server"
3. Click **Install** on "Live Server" by Ritwick Dey
4. This lets you see your webpage update in real-time!

### Step 3: Create your project

1. Create a new folder on your computer called `my-first-webpage`
2. In VS Code, go to **File → Open Folder**
3. Select the `my-first-webpage` folder you just created
4. In VS Code, create a new file: **File → New File**
5. Save it as `index.html` (File → Save As)

**Checkpoint:** You should now have VS Code open with an empty `index.html` file.

---

## Part 2: Build the HTML structure 

### Your task:

Create an HTML page with the following elements:

**Required elements:**
1. A [heading](https://www.w3schools.com/html/html_headings.asp) with your name (or team name)
2. A [paragraph](https://www.w3schools.com/html/html_paragraphs.asp) describing yourself (or your team)
3. A [list](https://www.w3schools.com/html/html_lists.asp) of at least 3 things about you (hobbies, skills, interests, etc.)
4. A button that says "Click me!"
5. An empty div with [id="message"](https://www.w3schools.com/html/html_id.asp) where text will appear ***(bonus challenge)***

### Starter code:

 Type the exclamation mark (!) in your `index.html` file, press `enter` and see what happens  **OR** copy this basic structure into the file 

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
    <title>About Me</title>
</head>
<body>
    <h1>Your Name Here</h1>
    
    <!-- Add your content here -->
    
</body>
</html>
```

### View your page:

1. Right-click on `index.html` in VS Code
2. Select "Open with Live Server"
3. Your page should open in your browser!

**Checkpoint:** You should see your name, description, list, and button in the browser.

#### _Bonus questions if extra time is left at the end of the session:_

1. What does `<!DOCTYPE html>` tell the browser?
2. What goes inside the `<head>` section vs the `<body>` section?
3. What's the difference between `<h1>` and `<h2>` tags?
4. How do you create a button in HTML?

---

## Part 3: Style with CSS 

### Your task:

Make your page look professional using CSS. Add styles for colors, spacing, fonts, and layout.

**Required styling:**
1. [Center](https://www.w3schools.com/css/css_text_align.asp) all content on the page
2. Add a [background color](https://www.w3schools.com/css/css_background.asp)
3. Style the button with a background color and padding
4. Make the button changes color when you [hover](https://www.w3schools.com/cssref/sel_hover.php) over it

### Add CSS:

Inside the `<head>` section, add a `<link>` tag that connects to your `styles.css` file:
```html
<head>
    <title>About Me</title>
    <link rel="stylesheet" href="styles.css">
</head>
```

Then, in your styles.css file, add these styles:
```
body {
    /* Add your styles here */
}

h1 {
    /* Style your heading */
}

button {
    /* Style your button */
}

button:hover {
    /* Style for when mouse hovers over button */
}
```

### Styling ideas:

**Background:**
- `background: #f0f0f0;` (light gray)
- `background: linear-gradient(to right, #667eea, #764ba2);` (gradient)

**Text:**
- `color: white;`
- `font-family: Arial, sans-serif;`
- `text-align: center;`

**Button:**
- `padding: 15px 30px;` (space inside button)
- `background: blue;`
- `color: white;`
- `border: none;`
- `border-radius: 10px;` (rounded corners)
- `cursor: pointer;` (hand cursor on hover)

**Checkpoint:** Your page should now look styled and professional.


#### _Bonus questions if extra time is left at the end of the session:_

6. What is the difference between `margin` and `padding`?
7. What does `cursor: pointer;` do?
8. How do you change what happens when someone hovers over the button?

## Part 4: Add JavaScript interactivity 

### Your Task:

Make the button create an [**alert**](https://www.w3schools.com/jsref/met_win_alert.asp) with text "Hello World!" when clicked.

---

**0. Don't forget to link your JavaScript file to HTML file**

At the bottom of your `<body>`, before the closing `</body>` tag, add a `<script>` tag that connects to your `script.js` file:

```html
<body>
    <!-- Your HTML content here -->
    
    <script src="script.js"></script>
</body>
```

---

### Step 1: Get the button element in JavaScript

First, you need to tell JavaScript which button you want to work with. You do this by creating a **variable** and assigning it the value of the button from your HTML.

**In your HTML (`index.html`)**, make sure your button has an **id**:

```html
<button id="myButton">Click me!</button>
```

**In your JavaScript (`script.js`)**: create a variable to store the button from HTML by using JavaScript method `document.getElementById`:

```javascript
// Get the button element from HTML
const button = document.getElementById('yourIdHere');
```

**What this does:**
- `document.getElementById('myButton')` - finds the HTML element with specified id
- `const button` - creates a variable called "button" to store that element
- Now JavaScript knows which button you're talking about!

---

### Step 2: Add a Click Event to the button

Now that JavaScript knows about your button, you need to tell it to "listen" for clicks on that button.

**Add this to your `script.js`:**

```javascript
// Get the button element from HTML
const button = document.getElementById('yourIdHere');

// Add a click event listener to the button
button.addEventListener('click', handleClick);
```

**What this does:**
- `addEventListener('click', handleClick)` - tells the button to listen for clicks
- When the button is clicked, it will call the `handleClick` function
- Think of it as: "Hey button, when someone clicks you, run the handleClick function"

---

### Step 3: Create a Function That Alerts When the Button is Clicked

Finally, create the **function** that will run when the button is clicked. This function will show an alert with "Hello World!"

**Add this to your `script.js`:**

```javascript
// Get the button element from HTML
const button = document.getElementById('myButton');

// Add a click event listener to the button
button.addEventListener('click', handleClick);

// Create the function that runs when button is clicked
function handleClick() {
    //your code here
}
```

**What this does:**
- `function handleClick()` - creates a function named "handleClick"
- `code you write yourself` - shows a popup box with the text "Hello World!"
- When the button is clicked, this function runs and shows the alert!

---

### Complete Setup Instructions:



**2. Create `script.js` file**

Create a new file called `script.js` in the same folder as your `index.html` and add the complete code:

```javascript
// Step 1: Get the button element from HTML
const button = document.getElementById('myButton');

// Step 2: Add a click event listener to the button
button.addEventListener('click', handleClick);

// Step 3: Create the function that runs when button is clicked
function handleClick() {
    alert('Hello World!');
}
```

---

### Test Your Code:

1. Save both `index.html` and `script.js`
2. Refresh your browser (or Live Server will auto-refresh)
3. Click the button
4. You should see a popup alert saying "Hello World!" 

---

**Checkpoint:** Clicking the button should show "Hello World!" as an alert and your project folder should now look like this:

```
my-first-webpage/
├── index.html
├── styles.css
└── script.js
```

---

## Part 5: Final touches

1. Add an image: `<img src="URL_HERE" alt="description" />`
2. Change colors to match your style
3. Add more sections (Education, Experience, Contact Info, etc.)
