## What is HTML?

HTML (HyperText Markup Language) is the skeleton of every webpage. It defines the structure and content - what elements appear on the page and how they're organized. Think of it as the blueprint or frame of a building before any decoration is added.

### How HTML Works

HTML uses **tags** to mark up content. Tags are like labels that tell the browser "this is a heading," "this is a paragraph," or "this is a button."

**Basic syntax:**

```html
<tagname>Content goes here</tagname>
```

The opening tag `<tagname>` and closing tag `</tagname>` wrap around the content.

### Common HTML Elements

**Structure Elements:**
- `<html>` - The root element that contains everything
- `<head>` - Contains metadata (title, links to CSS files, etc.)
- `<body>` - Contains the visible content of the page

**Content Elements:**
- `<h1>, <h2>, <h3>` - Headings (h1 is largest, h6 is smallest)
- `<p>` - Paragraph text
- `<div>` - A container for grouping elements
- `<span>` - A container for inline content

**Form Elements:**
- `<form>` - Container for form inputs
- `<input>` - User input fields (text, email, password, etc.)
- `<button>` - Clickable button
- `<label>` - Label for an input field

### Example: Login Form Structure

```html
<div class="login-form">
    <h2>Login</h2>
    <input type="email" id="email" placeholder="Email" />
    <input type="password" id="password" placeholder="Password" />
    <button onclick="handleLogin()">Login</button>
    <div id="message"></div>
</div>
```

**Breaking it down:**
- `<div class="login-form">` - Container grouping all login elements
- `<h2>Login</h2>` - Heading displaying "Login"
- `<input type="email">` - Email input field (browser validates email format)
- `<input type="password">` - Password field (hides characters)
- `<button onclick="handleLogin()">` - Button that calls JavaScript function when clicked
- `<div id="message">` - Empty container where success/error messages will appear

### Key Concepts

**Attributes:**

HTML elements can have attributes that provide additional information:
- `id="email"` - Unique identifier for the element
- `class="login-form"` - Groups elements for styling
- `type="password"` - Specifies the input type
- `placeholder="Email"` - Gray text shown before user types
- `onclick="handleLogin()"` - JavaScript function to run when clicked

**Semantic HTML:**

Using the right HTML element for the job improves:
- **Accessibility** - Screen readers can understand the page structure
- **SEO** - Search engines better understand your content
- **Maintainability** - Code is easier to read and update

### Why HTML Matters for Non-Developers

Understanding HTML helps you:
- **Communicate with developers** - "We need an email input field with validation"
- **Write better requirements** - Specify exact elements needed
- **Debug issues** - Understand what's on the page and how it's structured
- **Inspect pages** - Use DevTools to see how any website is built

### HTML Alone is Not Enough

HTML only defines structure - it doesn't:
- Style the page (that's CSS)
- Make it interactive (that's JavaScript)
- Store or process data (that's the backend)

But it's the foundation everything else builds upon.
