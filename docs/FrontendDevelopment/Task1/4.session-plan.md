## Your mission

Build an "About Me" (or "About Us" if working in a team) webpage from scratch using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Your page will include a button that shows "Hello World!" when clicked.

## What You'll Learn in This Session

By the end of this session, you'll understand:

- How HTML creates page structure  
- How CSS makes things look good  
- How JavaScript makes pages interactive  

**Most importantly:** You'll build your first web page from scratch!

## The StartSchools Approach

**Remember: The best way to learn is by doing.**

You won't just read about frontend development - you'll:
- Build a real page from scratch
- Break things and fix them
- Use the same tools professional developers use
- Learn by trial and error (just like real development!)

**No memorization required.** Professional developers constantly:
- Google things they forget
- Read documentation
- Copy and modify examples
- Debug step by step
