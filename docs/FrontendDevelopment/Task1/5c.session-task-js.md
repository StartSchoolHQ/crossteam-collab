## Part 4: Add JavaScript interactivity 

### Your Task:

Make the button create an [**alert**](https://www.w3schools.com/jsref/met_win_alert.asp) with text "Hello World!" when clicked.

---

**Don't forget to link your JavaScript file to HTML file**

At the bottom of your `<body>`, before the closing `</body>` tag, add a `<script>` tag that connects to your `script.js` file:

```html
<body>
    <!-- Your HTML content here -->
    
    <script src="script.js"></script>
</body>
```

---

### Step 1: Get the button element in JavaScript

First, you need to tell JavaScript which button you want to work with. You do this by creating a **variable** and assigning it the value of the button from your HTML.

**In your HTML**, make sure your button has an **id**:

```html
<button id="yourIdhere">Click me!</button>
```

**In your JavaScript** create a **variable** to store the button from HTML by using JavaScript method `document.getElementById`:

```javascript
// Get the button element from HTML
const button = document.getElementById('yourIdHere');
```

**What this does:**
- `document.getElementById('myButton')` - finds the HTML element with specified [id](https://www.w3schools.com/jsref/met_document_getelementbyid.asp)
- `const button` - creates a [variable](https://www.w3schools.com/js/js_variables.asp) called "button" to store that element
- Now JavaScript knows which button you're talking about!

---

### Step 2: Add a Click Event to the button

Now that JavaScript knows about your button, you need to tell it to "listen" for clicks on that button.

**Add this to your `script.js`:**

```javascript
// Get the button element from HTML
const button = document.getElementById('yourIdHere');

// Add a click event listener to the button
button.addEventListener('click', handleClick);
```

**What this does:**
- `addEventListener('click', handleClick)` - tells the button to listen for clicks
- When the button is clicked, it will call the `handleClick` function
- Think of it as: "Hey button, when someone clicks you, run the handleClick function"

---

### Step 3: Create a Function That Alerts When the Button is Clicked

Finally, create the **function** that will run when the button is clicked. This function will show an alert with "Hello World!"

**Add this to your `script.js`:**

```javascript
// Get the button element from HTML
const button = document.getElementById('yourIdHere');

// Add a click event listener to the button
button.addEventListener('click', handleClick);

// Create the function that runs when button is clicked
function handleClick() {
    //your code here
}
```

**What this does:**
- `function handleClick()` - creates a function named "handleClick"
- `code you write yourself` - shows a popup box with the text "Hello World!"
- When the button is clicked, this function runs and shows the alert!


---

### Test Your Code:

1. Save both `index.html` and `script.js`
2. Refresh your browser (or Live Server will auto-refresh)
3. Click the button
4. You should see a popup alert saying "Hello World!" 

---

### Checkpoint
Clicking the button should show "Hello World!" as an alert and your project folder should now look like this:

```
my-first-webpage/
├── index.html
├── styles.css
└── script.js
```
