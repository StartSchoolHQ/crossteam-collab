## Part 2: Build the HTML structure 

### Your task:

Create an HTML page with the following elements:

**Required elements:**
1. A [heading](https://www.w3schools.com/html/html_headings.asp) with your name (or team name)
2. A [paragraph](https://www.w3schools.com/html/html_paragraphs.asp) describing yourself (or your team)
3. A [list](https://www.w3schools.com/html/html_lists.asp) of at least 3 things about you (hobbies, skills, interests, etc.)
4. A button that says "Click me!"
5. An empty div with [id="message"](https://www.w3schools.com/html/html_id.asp) where text will appear ***(bonus challenge)***

### Starter code:

 Type the exclamation mark (!) in your `index.html` file, press `enter` and see what happens  **OR** copy this basic structure into the file 

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
    <title>About Me</title>
</head>
<body>
    <h1>Your Name Here</h1>
    
    <!-- Add your content here -->
    
</body>
</html>
```

### View your page:

1. Right-click anywhere on your `index.html` file in VS Code
2. Select "Open with Live Server"
3. Your page should open in your browser!

### Checkpoint
You should see your name, description, list, and button in the browser.

#### _Bonus questions if extra time is left at the end of the session:_

1. What does `<!DOCTYPE html>` tell the browser?
2. What goes inside the `<head>` section vs the `<body>` section?
3. What's the difference between `<h1>` and `<h2>` tags?
4. How do you create a button in HTML?
