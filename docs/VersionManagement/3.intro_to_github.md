## What is [GitHub](https://github.com/)?

**GitHub** is a website where you can store your Git repositories online. Think of it as "Google Drive for code" but much more powerful.

### GitHub lets you:

- **Store code online** - backup and access from anywhere
- **Collaborate** - work with others on the same project
- **Share code** - make your projects public or keep them private
- **Review code** - comment on and discuss changes
- **Track issues** - manage bugs and feature requests
- **Deploy code** - many services can deploy directly from GitHub

### Git vs GitHub:

- **Git** = The tool on your computer that tracks changes
- **GitHub** = The website where you store and share those changes

**Analogy:**
- Git = Your photo app on your phone
- GitHub = Instagram (where you upload and share photos)
