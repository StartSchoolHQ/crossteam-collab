## Introduction to version control

Imagine you're writing an essay and you want to save different versions as you work:
- `essay_v1.docx`
- `essay_v2.docx`
- `essay_final.docx`
- `essay_final_FINAL.docx`
- `essay_final_FINAL_this_one.docx`

This gets messy fast! **Version control systems** solve this problem for code.

### What is version control?

Version control is a system that:
- Tracks every change you make to your files
- Lets you go back to any previous version
- Allows multiple people to work on the same project without conflicts
- Shows who changed what and when

## Why this matters for non-developers

Understanding Git and GitHub helps you:
- **Communicate with developers** - "Can you *push* your changes?" "What *branch* are you on?"
- **Track project progress** - See exactly what's being worked on
- **Review code** - Look at proposed changes before they go live
- **Understand workflow** - Know why developers need time for testing
- **Contribute** - Even non-coders can edit documentation
- **Troubleshoot** - "When did this bug appear?" Check *commit* history!
