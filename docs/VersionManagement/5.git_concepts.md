## Basic Git concepts

| Concept | Description | Examples / Notes |
|----------|--------------|------------------|
| **Repository (Repo)** | A **repository** is a project folder that Git is tracking. It contains:<br/>- All your code files<br/>- Complete history of all changes<br/>- Configuration and settings | Acts as the main container for your project |
| **Commit** | A **commit** is a snapshot of your project at a specific moment — like saving your game progress. Each commit has:<br/>- A unique ID<br/>- A message describing what changed<br/>- Who made the change and when<br/>- The actual changes to files | ✅ **Good message:** "Add login button to homepage"<br/>❌ **Bad message:** "stuff" or "changes" |
| **Branch** | A **branch** is a parallel version of your code. The main branch is usually called `main` or `master`.<br/><br/>**Why use branches?**<br/>- Work on new features without affecting main code<br/>- Multiple people can work on features simultaneously<br/>- Test ideas safely | **Example branches:**<br/>- `main` – stable, working version<br/>- `feature-login` – adding login functionality<br/>- `bugfix-button` – fixing a broken button<br/>- `experiment-new-design` – trying a new look |
| **Remote** | A **remote** is a version of your repository stored online (e.g., on GitHub). It allows you to share code and back up your work. | Examples: `origin`, GitHub, GitLab, Bitbucket |
