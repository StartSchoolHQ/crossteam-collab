## Why developers use Git and GitHub

### Real-world scenarios:

**Scenario 1: The "oops" moment**  
You accidentally delete important code. With Git, you can recover it instantly.

**Scenario 2: Multiple developers**  
Two developers work on different features. Git merges their work automatically.

**Scenario 3: Experimentation**  
Want to try a new approach? Create a "branch" to experiment without breaking your working code.

**Scenario 4: Code review**  
Before merging new code, teammates can review and suggest improvements.

**Scenario 5: Deployment**  
When code is ready, push to GitHub and your website updates automatically.
