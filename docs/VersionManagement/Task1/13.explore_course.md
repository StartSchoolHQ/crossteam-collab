## Part 7: Investigate how this course is built

This repository uses a tool called Docusaurus to turn Markdown files into a website.

### Step 1: Explore the technology

1. **Find the `package.json` file.** What "dependencies" do you see listed?
2. **Can you find "docusaurus" mentioned?** This is the tool that builds the website.

### Step 2: Connect code to content

3. **Pick a lesson from the live website** (if accessible)
4. **Find the corresponding `.md` file in the GitHub repository**
5. **Compare them.** Notice how the Markdown formatting (like `##` for headers) becomes the formatted website?

### Step 3: Understanding the workflow

6. **Based on what you've learned, describe the workflow:**
    - Someone writes a lesson in a `.md` file
    - They commit the change to GitHub
    - Then what happens? How does it become a website?

**Checkpoint:** You understand how this course repository works.
