## Part 3: Investigate the commit history (30 minutes)

Commits are like a timeline of changes to the project. Let's see how this course was built!

### Step 1: View commit history

1. Click on the **commits** link (above the file list, shows the number of commits)
2. You'll see a list of all changes made to this project

### Step 2: Explore commits

**Answer these questions:**

14. **What is the most recent commit about?** (Read the commit message at the top)
15. **Who made the most recent commit?** (Look at the author name and profile picture)
16. **When was it made?** (Look at the date)
17. **Scroll down through the commit history.** Can you find the very first commit? What was it about?

### Step 3: Examine a specific commit

18. **Click on any commit message.** You'll see what files were changed.
19. **What do the green lines with `+` mean?**
20. **What do the red lines with `-` mean?**
21. **Can you find a commit that added a new course section?** What was added?

### Step 4: Track when content was added

22. **Find a specific file (like `workflow2.md`).** Click on it.
23. **Click the "History" button** (top right of the file viewer)
24. **How many times has this file been changed?**
25. **Click on the oldest change.** What did the file look like originally?

**âœ… Checkpoint:** You understand how to track changes over time in this course.
