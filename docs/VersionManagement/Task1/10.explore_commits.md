## Part 3: Investigate the commit history

Commits are like a timeline of changes to the project. Let's see how this course was built!

### Step 1: View commit history

1. Click on the **commits** link (above the file list, shows the number of commits)
2. You'll see a list of all changes made to this project

### Step 2: Explore commits

**Answer these questions:**

1. **What is the most recent commit about?** (Read the commit message at the top)
2. **Who made the most recent commit?** (Look at the author name and profile picture)
3. **When was it made?** (Look at the date)
4. **Scroll down through the commit history.** Can you find the very first commit? What was it about?

### Step 3: Examine a specific commit

5. **Click on any commit message.** You'll see what files were changed.
6. **What do the green lines with `+` mean?**
7. **What do the red lines with `-` mean?**

### Step 4: Track when content was added

8. **Find a specific file (like `8.task_github.md`).** Click on it.
9. **Click the "History" button** (top right of the file viewer)
10. **How many times has this file been changed?**

**Checkpoint:** You understand how to track changes over time in this course.
