## Part 4: Find specific course content 

Now let's practice finding specific information, like you might need to as a project manager.

### Step 1: Find frontend development content

1. **Navigate to the docs folder.** Can you find materials about frontend development?
2. **What is the file structure in the frontend development section?**

### Step 2: Search the repository

3. **Use GitHub's search** (press `/` or click the search bar at the top)
4. **Search for "API"** - how many files mention this term?
5. **Search for "database"** - can you find explanations about databases?

### Step 3: View the live website

6. **Look for a link to the live deployed website.** (Check the README or the "About" section on the right)
7. **Visit the website.** How does the GitHub repository relate to what you see on the website?

### Step 4: Understanding documentation structure

8. **Look at the `sidebars.js` file.** What do you think this file does?
9. **Check the `docusaurus.config.js` file.** What is the title of the site?

**Checkpoint:** You can find specific content within the repository.
