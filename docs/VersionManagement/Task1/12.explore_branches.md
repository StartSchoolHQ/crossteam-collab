## Part 6: Explore branches and collaboration

Branches let developers work on features separately without affecting the main content.

### Step 1: View branches

1. Click the **branch dropdown** (above the file list, says "main")
2. See what branches exist

**Answer these questions:**

1. **How many branches does this repository have?**
2. **What is the default branch called?**
3. **If there are other branches, what do you think they're for?** (Based on their names)

### Step 2: Compare the repository structure to what you learned

4. **Think about the restaurant analogy from earlier sessions.** How does this repository structure map to:
    - Frontend (dining room)?
    - Backend (kitchen)?
    - Documentation (menu)?

**Checkpoint:** You understand how the repository is organized for collaboration.
