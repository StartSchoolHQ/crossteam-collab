## Part 8: Reflection and application 

Now think about how this applies to your work.

### Questions to consider:

1. **If you were managing this course project, what information would you look for in this repository?**
    - How would you track progress?
    - How would you know what's being worked on?
    - How would you suggest improvements?

2. **Imagine a student reports a typo in a lesson. How would you:**
    - Find which file needs to be fixed?
    - See if someone already reported it?
    - Track when it gets fixed?

3. **If you wanted to add a new lesson to this course, what would you need to do?**
    - Which folder would you put it in?
    - What format should it be in?
    - How would you make it appear on the website?

**Write down your answers - we'll discuss them together.**

**Checkpoint:** You can apply GitHub knowledge to real project management scenarios.
