## Part 2: Explore the course repository

We'll explore the repository that contains the materials for this very course you're taking.

### Step 1: Navigate to the repository

Go to: [https://github.com/StartSchoolHQ/crossteam-collab](https://github.com/StartSchoolHQ/crossteam-collab)

### Step 2: Understand the repository overview

**Answer these questions by exploring the page:**

1. **What is this repository about?** (Find the description)
2. **Who owns this repository?** (Look at the username before the repository name)
3. **How many commits have been made?** (Look for the commits count above the file list)
4. **When was the last update?** (Look under "Latest commit")
5. **How many branches exist?** (Click the branch dropdown that says "main")

### Step 3: Explore the file structure

**Find and open these items:**

6. **What is the main folder called that contains course documentation?** (Look for a folder name that might contain course materials)
7. **Click on the `docs` folder.** What subfolders do you see inside?
8. **Find a file that ends with `.md`** (these are Markdown files). What is it about?
9. **Find the `package.json` file.** What is the project name listed inside?
10. **Is there a `README.md` file?** What does it say? (Scroll down on the main page to see it)

### Step 4: Understanding course materials

11. **Navigate to `docs/WebAppWorkflow/`** What files do you find here?
12. **Open one of the `.md` files.** Can you understand what this lesson is about?
13. **Go back to the main page.** Find the `static` folder. What's inside the `img` folder?

**Checkpoint:** You can navigate the course repository and find key files.
