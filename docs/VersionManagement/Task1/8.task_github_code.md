## Your mission

Explore the **[StartSchool Cross-Team Collaboration](https://github.com/StartSchoolHQ/crossteam-collab)** repository to understand how developers collaborate, track changes, and organize code. You'll practice navigating GitHub like a project manager or product owner would - finding information, tracking changes, and understanding team workflows.

**No coding required!** This is all about exploring and understanding.

---

## Part 1: Create your GitHub account

### Step 1: Sign up for GitHub

1. Go to [https://github.com](https://github.com)
2. Click **Sign up**
3. Enter your email, create a password, choose a username
4. Complete the verification
5. Select "Free" plan
6. You can skip the questionnaire or fill it out

### Step 2: Explore your profile

1. Click your profile picture in top right
2. Click **Your profile**
3. This is your GitHub homepage - it will show your activity and repositories

**Checkpoint:** You have a GitHub account and can see your profile.

---

## Part 5: Find specific course content (20 minutes)

Now let's practice finding specific information, like you might need to as a project manager.

### Step 1: Find frontend development content

33. **Navigate to the docs folder.** Can you find materials about frontend development?
34. **What topics are covered in the frontend development section?**

### Step 2: Search the repository

35. **Use GitHub's search** (press `/` or click the search bar at the top)
36. **Search for "API"** - how many files mention this term?
37. **Search for "database"** - can you find explanations about databases?

### Step 3: View the live website

38. **Look for a link to the live deployed website.** (Check the README or the "About" section on the right)
39. **Visit the website.** How does the GitHub repository relate to what you see on the website?

### Step 4: Understanding documentation structure

40. **Look at the `sidebars.js` file.** What do you think this file does?
41. **Check the `docusaurus.config.js` file.** What is the title of the site?

**‚úÖ Checkpoint:** You can find specific content within the repository.

---

## Part 6: Explore branches and collaboration (15 minutes)

Branches let developers work on features separately without affecting the main content.

### Step 1: View branches

1. Click the **branch dropdown** (above the file list, says "main")
2. See what branches exist

**Answer these questions:**

42. **How many branches does this repository have?**
43. **What is the default branch called?**
44. **If there are other branches, what do you think they're for?** (Based on their names)

### Step 2: Compare the repository structure to what you learned

45. **Think about the restaurant analogy from earlier sessions.** How does this repository structure map to:
    - Frontend (dining room)?
    - Backend (kitchen)?
    - Documentation (menu)?

**‚úÖ Checkpoint:** You understand how the repository is organized for collaboration.

---

## Part 7: Investigate how this course is built (20 minutes)

This repository uses a tool called Docusaurus to turn Markdown files into a website.

### Step 1: Explore the technology

46. **Find the `package.json` file.** What "dependencies" do you see listed?
47. **Can you find "docusaurus" mentioned?** This is the tool that builds the website.

### Step 2: Connect code to content

48. **Pick a lesson from the live website** (if accessible)
49. **Find the corresponding `.md` file in the GitHub repository**
50. **Compare them.** Notice how the Markdown formatting (like `##` for headers) becomes the formatted website?

### Step 3: Understanding the workflow

51. **Based on what you've learned, describe the workflow:**
    - Someone writes a lesson in a `.md` file
    - They commit the change to GitHub
    - Then what happens? How does it become a website?

**‚úÖ Checkpoint:** You understand how this course repository works.

---

## Part 8: Reflection and application (15 minutes)

Now think about how this applies to your work.

### Questions to consider:

52. **If you were managing this course project, what information would you look for in this repository?**
    - How would you track progress?
    - How would you know what's being worked on?
    - How would you suggest improvements?

53. **Imagine a student reports a typo in a lesson. How would you:**
    - Find which file needs to be fixed?
    - See if someone already reported it?
    - Track when it gets fixed?

54. **If you wanted to add a new lesson to this course, what would you need to do?**
    - Which folder would you put it in?
    - What format should it be in?
    - How would you make it appear on the website?

**Write down your answers - we'll discuss them together.**

**‚úÖ Checkpoint:** You can apply GitHub knowledge to real project management scenarios.

## Bonus challenges

**If you have extra time, try these:**

**Easy:**
1. Star ‚≠ê the repository to bookmark it
2. Watch üëÅÔ∏è the repository to get notifications about updates
3. Find the Contributors page (Insights ‚Üí Contributors) - who has contributed most?

**Medium:**
1. Create an issue suggesting a typo fix or content improvement (be specific and helpful!)
2. Compare two different commits to see exactly what changed between them
3. Find when a specific piece of content was added (use file history)

**Advanced:**
1. Fork the repository to make your own copy
2. Explore the GitHub Actions tab (if available) - what automated processes run?
3. Check the Network graph (Insights ‚Üí Network) to see the branch structure visually

## What you've learned

By completing this task, you now understand:

‚úÖ How to navigate GitHub repositories
‚úÖ How to find specific files and content
‚úÖ How to view the history of changes (commits)
‚úÖ How teams track improvements and bugs (issues)
‚úÖ How content is organized in a real project
‚úÖ How documentation becomes a website
‚úÖ How to use GitHub as a project management tool

**Why this matters for cross-team collaboration:**

Understanding GitHub helps you:
- **Track course progress** - see exactly what content is being added
- **Find answers** - look through issues to see if a question was already asked
- **Communicate with developers** - use correct terminology (commits, branches, files)
- **Review content** - check what's being added before it goes live
- **Suggest improvements** - create issues with specific suggestions
- **Understand timelines** - see when features or content were added

---

## Reflection questions

After completing this exploration, answer these:

1. **What surprised you most about how this course repository is organized?**
2. **How could you use GitHub to collaborate on projects in your current work?**
3. **What's one thing you found confusing that you'd like explained more?**
4. **If you were creating a similar project, what would you organize differently?**

## Real-world application

**Scenario:** Imagine you're a project manager for this course.

**Task 1:** A student emails saying "Lesson 3 has a broken link." 
- How would you find Lesson 3 in the repository?
- How would you report this issue to the development team?
- How would you verify when it's fixed?

**Task 2:** You want to add a new section about APIs.
- Where would you put the new file?
- What format should it be in?
- How would you communicate to the team what you want to add?

**Task 3:** You want to see how the course has evolved.
- How would you view all changes made in the last week?
- How would you see who made the most contributions?
- How would you find when a specific topic was added?

**Write down your approach - these are skills you'll use in cross-team collaboration!**

---

## Next steps

- **Bookmark this repository** - you'll be referring to it throughout the course
- **Check it regularly** - see how it evolves as new content is added
- **Create issues** - if you find typos or have suggestions
- **Explore the live website** - see how the code becomes content
- **Compare with other repositories** - see different organization styles

**Remember:** GitHub is not just for developers! Anyone working on team projects can use it to track work, share files, and collaborate effectively.

The best way to learn GitHub is to use it regularly. This repository is yours to explore - come back to it as you learn more!
