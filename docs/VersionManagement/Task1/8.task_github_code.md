## Your mission

Explore the **[StartSchool Cross-Team Collaboration](https://github.com/StartSchoolHQ/crossteam-collab)** repository to understand how developers collaborate, track changes, and organize code. You'll practice navigating GitHub like a project manager or product owner would - finding information, tracking changes, and understanding team workflows.

**No coding required!** This is all about exploring and understanding.
