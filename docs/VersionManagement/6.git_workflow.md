<!-- ## The Git workflow -->

Here's how developers typically work with Git:

```
1. Make changes to your code
   ↓
2. Stage the changes (select what to save)
   ↓
3. Commit the changes (save snapshot with message)
   ↓
4. Push to GitHub (upload to online backup)
```

### Visual example:

```
Your Computer:
[Write code] → [Stage changes] → [Commit] → [Push]
                                              ↓
GitHub (Online):
                                    [Repository updated]
```

## Git is executed with commands

Git uses a series of commands that are typed and run in the terminal.

---  

## Git has three areas


| Area | Description | Git Commands    | Example |
|-------|--------------|------------------|----------|
| **1. Working Directory** <br/>(your files) | Where you **edit files**. Changes here are **not tracked yet**.<br/>Think of it as your local workspace. | `git status`<br/> | Shows which files are modified but not yet staged:<br/>`modified: index.html` |
| **2. Staging Area** <br/>(what to save) | Where you **prepare changes** for the next commit.<br/>You choose what to include — like adding items to a shopping cart before checkout, not everything has to be included at once | `git add <filename>`<br/><br/>`git add .` | Add a specific file:<br/>`git add app.js`<br/><br/>Add all changed files:<br/>`git add .` |
| **3. Repository** <br/>(saved history) | Where **commits are stored** permanently — the version history of your project. | `git commit -m "message"`<br/><br/>`git log` | Save staged changes with a message:<br/>`git commit -m "Fix login bug"`<br/><br/>View commit history:<br/>`git log --oneline` |


### Why the staging area?

It lets you commit only some changes, not everything at once.

**Example:**
- You fixed a bug AND started a new feature
- Stage only the bug fix: `git add bugfix.js`
- Commit: `git commit -m "Fix login bug"`
- Later, stage and commit the new feature separately
