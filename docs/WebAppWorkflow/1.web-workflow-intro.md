# **Learn by doing — The StartSchool approach**

At **StartSchools**, we believe the best way to learn is by doing.  
Real programmers don't memorize everything — they **read documentation**, **google solutions**, **experiment with code**, and **tackle problems** even when the path forward isn't immediately clear.  

That’s exactly how our program works: you’ll learn by **replicating the daily workflow of professional developers**.

## **Purpose of this session**

This guide will help you understand how **web applications work end-to-end**, so you can follow user actions through the entire technical stack and communicate more effectively about system behavior.

---

## **Why this matters**

- **Follow technical discussions** — Understand what developers mean when they say “the API is slow” or “we need to optimize the database query.”  
- **Write better requirements** — Specify what you need more precisely by understanding how different components interact.  
- **Spot issues earlier** — Identify potential problems before they become expensive to fix by understanding the full workflow.  
- **Communicate effectively** — Bridge the gap between business needs and technical implementation.
