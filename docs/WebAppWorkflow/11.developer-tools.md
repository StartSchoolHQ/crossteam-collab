## Exploring Developer Tools

In this task, you'll use Chrome DevTools to investigate how websites communicate with servers. You'll inspect real network requests and see the data being sent back and forth.

### Setup

1. Open **Google Chrome** browser
2. Press **F12** (or right-click anywhere and select "Inspect") to open DevTools
3. Click on the **Network** tab at the top of DevTools

## Task 1: Observe a Login Request

**Your mission:** Watch what happens when you log in to a website

**Steps:**

1. Keep DevTools open with the Network tab selected
2. Go to a website with login (suggestions: GitHub.com, Twitter.com, or any site where you have an account)
3. Enter your credentials and click "Login"
4. Look at the Network tab - you'll see a list of requests appear

**Find and click on the login request** (it might be named "login", "session", "auth", or similar)

**Answer these questions by exploring the request:**

1. What is the Request URL? (Found at the top of the Headers tab)
2. What HTTP Method is used? (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE?)
3. What is the Status Code? (200, 401, 404, 500?)
4. Click on "Payload" or "Request" tab - what data is being sent? Can you see the email/username?
5. Click on "Response" tab - what does the server send back?
6. Look at "Headers" tab under "Response Headers" - do you see "set-cookie" or any session-related headers?

## Task 2: Make an API Call from Console

**Your mission:** Use the browser Console to fetch data from an API

**Steps:**

1. In DevTools, click on the **Console** tab
2. Copy and paste this code:

```javascript
fetch('https://api.github.com/users/github')
  .then(response => response.json())
  .then(data => {
    console.log('===== USER DATA =====');
    console.log(data);
    console.table(data);
  });
```

3. Press Enter

**Answer these questions:**

7. What information appears in the console? What fields do you see?
8. Try changing 'github' to another username (like your own GitHub username) and run it again. What happens?
9. Now try this URL that doesn't exist: `https://api.github.com/users/thisuserdoesnotexist123456`. What error do you get?

## Task 3: Inspect Browser Storage

**Your mission:** See where websites store data in your browser

**Steps:**

1. In DevTools, click on the **Application** tab (might be hidden under >> if your window is narrow)
2. On the left sidebar, expand "Local Storage"
3. Click on a website domain
4. On the left sidebar, expand "Cookies"
5. Click on a website domain

**Answer these questions:**

10. What kind of data do you see stored in Local Storage? (Look for things like tokens, user preferences, etc.)
11. What information is stored in Cookies? Do you see anything that looks like a session ID?
12. Try this: Find a cookie or localStorage item, right-click it, and delete it. Then refresh the page. What happens?

## Bonus Challenge

**Can you find:**
- A request that failed (Status Code in the 400s or 500s)?
- The time it took for a request to complete? (Hint: Look in the Network tab)
- Where your session token is stored after logging into a site?
