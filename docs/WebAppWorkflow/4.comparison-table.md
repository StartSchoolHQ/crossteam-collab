# Restaurant to Web Application - Step-by-Step Comparison 

| Step | Restaurant Action | Web Application Equivalent | Technical Component | Code Example |
|------|-------------------|----------------------------|---------------------|--------------|
| 1 | Customer looks at menu and decides on pasta | User browses products and clicks "Add to Cart" button | **Frontend UI** - HTML/CSS displays products | `<button onclick="addToCart(id)">` |
| 2 | Customer tells waiter: "I'd like the pasta carbonara" | JavaScript captures the click event and gets product details | **Frontend JavaScript** - Event listener | `btn.addEventListener('click',`<br />`() => addToCart(id))` |
| 3 | Waiter writes down the order | JavaScript packages the data (product ID, quantity, user ID) | **Data Preparation** - Creating request payload | `{productId: 123,`<br />`quantity: 1, userId: uid}` |
| 4 | Waiter carries order slip to kitchen | API sends HTTP POST request to server | **API Call** - fetch() or HTTP request | `fetch('/api/cart/add',`<br />`{method: 'POST', body: data})` |
| 5 | Order slip travels through restaurant | Request travels across internet to server | **Network/HTTPS** - Data transmission | HTTPS transmits request |
| 6 | Kitchen receives order slip | Server receives the request | **Backend Endpoint** - Route handler | `@app.route('/api/cart/add')`<br />`def add_to_cart(): ...` |
| 7 | Chef checks if pasta ingredients are in pantry | Server queries database to check product availability | **Database Query** - SELECT statement | `SELECT * FROM products`<br />`WHERE id=123 AND stock>0` |
| 8 | Chef finds ingredients available | Database returns: product exists, in stock | **Database Response** - Query results | `if product and`<br />`product.stock > 0:` |
| 9 | Chef takes ingredients from pantry | Server retrieves product details from database | **Data Retrieval** - Getting full product info | `product = get_product(id)` |
| 10 | Chef cooks the pasta | Server processes business logic (calculate price, apply discounts, validate) | **Business Logic** - Processing rules | `total = price * qty`<br />`apply_discounts(total)` |
| 11 | Chef updates inventory (marks pasta ingredients as used) | Server updates cart in database with new item | **Database Write** - INSERT/UPDATE statement | `INSERT INTO cart_items`<br />`VALUES (uid, pid, qty)` |
| 12 | Kitchen gives completed dish to waiter | Server creates success response with updated cart data | **Response Creation** - JSON response | `return {'success': True,`<br />`'cartTotal': 45.99}` |
| 13 | Waiter carries dish back to customer | API returns response to browser | **Network Response** - HTTP response | JSON travels back via HTTPS |
| 14 | Customer sees pasta arrive at table | Frontend receives response data | **Response Handling** - JavaScript .then() | `.then(r => r.json())`<br />`.then(data => ...)` |
| 15 | Customer enjoys their meal | Page updates to show item in cart with visual feedback | **UI Update** - DOM manipulation | `$('cart-count').textContent`<br />`= response.itemCount` |
