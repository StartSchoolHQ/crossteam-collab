## Restaurant vs Web app
Imagine you're at a restaurant. You look at the menu (**frontend**), decide what you want, and tell the waiter (**API**). The waiter carries your order to the kitchen (**backend**), where the chef checks if ingredients are available in the pantry (**database**), cooks your meal, and sends it back through the waiter to your table. Web apps work approximately the same way.
