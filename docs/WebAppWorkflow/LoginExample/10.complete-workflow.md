**Even though the user interface is simple—just two input fields and one button—a single click triggers a complex chain of events. Behind the scenes, the code orchestrates multiple steps: validating user input, packaging data into JSON format, sending an HTTP request across the internet to the server, querying the database, verifying credentials, generating security tokens, and finally redirecting the user. What appears as an instant action actually involves dozens of processes happening in milliseconds across frontend, backend, API, and database layers.**
