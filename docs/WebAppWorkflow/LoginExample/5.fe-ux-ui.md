## **Questions to explore in the code**

Use the following questions to analyze both **technical** and **user experience** aspects of your implementation.


**Structure & Functionality:**

1. What information does the user need to provide to log in?
2. Where will feedback messages appear on the page?
3. What happens when the Login button is clicked?

**Business Requirements:**

4. What type of authentication method is being used?
5. How can you tell that the password is hidden from view?

**Styling & User Experience:**

6. Is the login form responsive to different screen sizes?
7. What visual styling makes the button look clickable?
8. How much spacing is there between input fields and why does it matter?
