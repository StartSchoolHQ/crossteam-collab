## Restaurant vs Web application
| Restaurant         | Web Application        |
|--------------------|------------------------|
| Dining Room (what you see) | Frontend (UI/UX)|
| Menu               | User Interface Elements|
| Waiter             | API                    |
| Kitchen            | Backend/Server         |
| Pantry/Fridge      | Database               |
| Chef               | Business Logic         |

Imagine you're at a restaurant. You look at the menu (frontend), decide what you want, and tell the waiter (API). The waiter carries your order to the kitchen (backend), where the chef checks if ingredients are available in the pantry (database), cooks your meal (business logic), and sends it back through the waiter to your table. Web apps work exactly the same way.

## Restaurant to Web Application - Step-by-Step Comparison

| Step | Restaurant Action | Web Application Equivalent | Technical Component |
|------|-------------------|----------------------------|---------------------|
| 1 | Customer looks at menu and decides on pasta | User browses products and clicks "Add to Cart" button | **Frontend UI** - HTML/CSS displays products |
| 2 | Customer tells waiter: "I'd like the pasta carbonara" | JavaScript captures the click event and gets product details | **Frontend JavaScript** - Event listener |
| 3 | Waiter writes down the order | JavaScript packages the data (product ID, quantity, user ID) | **Data Preparation** - Creating request payload |
| 4 | Waiter carries order slip to kitchen | API sends HTTP POST request to server | **API Call** - fetch() or HTTP request |
| 5 | Order slip travels through restaurant | Request travels across internet to server | **Network/HTTPS** - Data transmission |
| 6 | Kitchen receives order slip | Server receives the request | **Backend Endpoint** - Route handler |
| 7 | Chef checks if pasta ingredients are in pantry | Server queries database to check product availability | **Database Query** - SELECT statement |
| 8 | Chef finds ingredients available | Database returns: product exists, in stock | **Database Response** - Query results |
| 9 | Chef takes ingredients from pantry | Server retrieves product details from database | **Data Retrieval** - Getting full product info |
| 10 | Chef cooks the pasta | Server processes business logic (calculate price, apply discounts, validate) | **Business Logic** - Processing rules |
| 11 | Chef updates inventory (marks pasta ingredients as used) | Server updates cart in database with new item | **Database Write** - INSERT/UPDATE statement |
| 12 | Kitchen gives completed dish to waiter | Server creates success response with updated cart data | **Response Creation** - JSON response |
| 13 | Waiter carries dish back to customer | API returns response to browser | **Network Response** - HTTP response |
| 14 | Customer sees pasta arrive at table | Frontend receives response data | **Response Handling** - JavaScript .then() |
| 15 | Customer enjoys their meal | Page updates to show item in cart with visual feedback | **UI Update** - DOM manipulation |
