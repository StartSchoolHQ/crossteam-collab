## Types of APIs

### REST APIs (most common)

**REST** (Representational State Transfer) is the most popular API style.

**Key characteristics:**
- Uses standard HTTP methods - An HTTP method tells the server what kind of action you want to perform (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE)
- Works with URLs (endpoints)
- Returns data in JSON or XML format
- Stateless (each request is independent)

**Example REST API endpoints:**

```
GET    /api/users          - Get all users
GET    /api/users/123      - Get user with ID 123
POST   /api/users          - Create a new user
PUT    /api/users/123      - Update user 123
DELETE /api/users/123      - Delete user 123
```
