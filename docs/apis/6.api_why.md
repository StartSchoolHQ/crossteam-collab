## Why APIs matter for non-developers

Understanding APIs helps you:

### For project managers

- **Estimate timelines** - "Integrating this API will take X days"
- **Understand dependencies** - "We need to wait for their API to be ready"
- **Make technical decisions** - "Should we build this or use an API?"
- **Communicate with developers** - Speak the same language

### For product owners

- **Evaluate features** - "Can we add Google login using their API?"
- **Understand limitations** - "The API only allows 100 requests/hour"
- **Plan integrations** - "Which third-party services should we connect?"
- **Assess feasibility** - "Is there an API for that?"

### For business analysts

- **Write requirements** - "System must integrate with payment API"
- **Document workflows** - "User clicks button → API call → Display result"
- **Understand data flow** - "Where does this data come from?"
- **Identify bottlenecks** - "The API is slow, causing delays"
