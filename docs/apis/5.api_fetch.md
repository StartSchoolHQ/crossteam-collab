## Understanding fetch()

Before we start coding, let's understand the tool we'll use to make API calls.

### What is fetch()?

**fetch()** is a JavaScript function built into modern browsers that lets you make HTTP requests to APIs. Think of it as your code's way of asking another server for data.

**Basic syntax:**
```javascript
fetch(url)
    .then(response => response.json())
    .then(data => {
        // Use the data here
    })
    .catch(error => {
        // Handle errors here
    });
```

### How fetch() works

**Step by step:**

1. **Make the request:**
```javascript
fetch('https://api.example.com/data')
```
Your browser sends a request to the API

2. **Wait for response:**
```javascript
.then(response => response.json())
```
The API sends back data, we convert it from JSON to JavaScript

3. **Use the data:**
```javascript
.then(data => {
    console.log(data);
})
```
Now you can display or use the data

4. **Handle errors:**
```javascript
.catch(error => {
    console.error('Something went wrong!', error);
})
```
If anything fails, this catches the error

### Why the dots (.then)?

API calls take time (milliseconds to seconds). JavaScript doesn't wait - it keeps running other code.

**Without fetch:**
```javascript
let data = getData();  // Takes 2 seconds
console.log(data);     // Runs immediately - data not ready yet!
```

**With fetch and .then:**
```javascript
fetch(url)
    .then(data => {
        console.log(data);  // Runs ONLY when data is ready
    });
console.log('This runs immediately while fetch is still loading');
```

This is called **asynchronous programming** - doing things at the same time without waiting.
